## 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side.

## 2. How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

## 3. What are callbacks in Node.js? Provide an example of using a callback.

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed later when a certain operation is complete. They are commonly used in asynchronous programming in Node.js.

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = 'Hello, World!';
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## 4. What is the purpose of the package.json file in Node.js?

The package.json file contains metadata about the Node.js project and its dependencies. It includes project details, script definitions, and dependency information.

## 5. What is the difference between require and import in Node.js?

require is the traditional way of importing modules in Node.js, while import is a newer syntax introduced in ECMAScript modules (ESM) standard. require is used for CommonJS modules, whereas import is used for ES modules.

## 6. Explain the concept of streams in Node.js. Provide an example of reading a file using streams.

Streams are objects used for handling continuous data flow. They allow you to read or write data in chunks, instead of loading the entire content into memory.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk.toString());
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading the file.');
});
```

## 7. What is middleware in Node.js and how does it work? Provide an example of creating custom middleware.

Middleware in Node.js refers to a function that sits between the server and the routes, allowing you to perform additional processing on requests and responses.

```javascript
function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`Received ${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
  next();
}

app.use(logger);
```

## 8. How do you handle errors in Node.js? Provide an example of error handling using try-catch.

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
}
```

## 9. What is the purpose of the Node.js event loop?

The event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous operations in Node.js. It ensures that non-blocking I/O operations are efficiently managed, allowing the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.

## 10. What is npm and what is it used for in Node.js?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install, manage, and publish JavaScript packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects.
